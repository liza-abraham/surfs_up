Analysis of Oahu Key Weather Patterns for June and December

Purpose of Analysis: 
A Surf â€˜n Shake establishment that furnishes both consumables and higher-ticket items like bespoke surf boards to tourists and residents. Since this is a brick-and-mortar operation, it is crucial to assess weather patterns in the proposed area to plan for foot traffic, and ensure that the business model is sound. 

Method
An SQLlite data set containing information on the past years of weather has been loaded, filtered, and visualized using a Juypter Notebooks and a Pandas dataframe. 

Results:
- Analysis indicates that 75% of days in a normal June for the location are over 77 degrees fahrenheit, with a mean temperature of 74, and an occasional maximum of 85. 
- This would indicate that summer presents a steady income stream for cold, milkshake consumables. 
- There appears to be little variation on the other end of the year. In December, the mean temperature is only three degrees less than the mean for June. 
- In addition, 75% of days reach at least 74 degrees. 
- Lack of variation between the two ends of the year indicate that milkshake consumables should provide a steady income stream to undergird larger-ticket sales of surf items. 

Additional Analysis 
Additional queries that should be conducted are 
-average windspeed for each month
=Percent cloud cover on an average day for each month. 

This would give a more granular picture about the viability of a milkshake income stream.
